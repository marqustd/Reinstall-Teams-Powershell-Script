# Reinstall Teams Powershell Script

## Purpose

The script is intended to be used to completly reinstall Teams on a Windows machine. It can uninstall Teams, clear Teams cache, and reinstall Teams.

## Why?

Because Teams desktop app is really broken and I don't want to spend time on manually reinstalling it all the time.
